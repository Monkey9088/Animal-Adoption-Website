        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          We are an animal shelter dedicated to helping out pets of many sizes
          and shapes! We began in 2022 as a non-profit due to a passion to
          promote the adoption of animals that need a home. We hope you browse
          through our pet category and find an adorable friend to take home with
          you!
        </p>
        <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          We respect, honor, and value diversity, and we are committed to
          cultivating and preserving a culture of inclusion and collaboration.
          We can best serve our community with a diverse team of volunteers. We
          welcome the unique contributions that every person can bring to our
          organization no matter their ethnicity, race, sex, gender identity and
          expression, nation of origin, age, languages spoken, religion,
